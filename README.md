# Code Examples Library 📚


## Why does this repo exist? 🤔

I got flooded with DMs asking for the scripts made for the Youtube and TikTok shorts to be sent directly to different users. The easiest way to do this was to just make it publicly available for anyone that wants to learn it or use it for different reasons.  

So I'll be storing the code snippets I use in my online content so you can replicate the examples in your own environments or use it as a learning resource in a way that makes sense for you!


## Who can use it? 🌍

Anyone can use the code for any purposes, and it's designed for beginners and advanced developers alike. 

I try to write the code in a way that's easy for myself to read and follow without compromising on best practices, and hopefully the same applies to you. 


## Can I copy and paste your code for my project...? 📋

Yeah of course! 

Feel free to use it as you need.


## How's the repo structured...? 📂

At the moment, the code examples are split into these directories:

- `/python` - for Python-related tutorials and examples.
- `/sql` - for SQL-related tutorials and examples.
