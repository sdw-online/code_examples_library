# Code Examples Library 📚


## Why does this repo exist? 🤔


For the past couple of weeks (from Dec 2023-Jan 2024), my DMs have been flooded with requests for the scripts I made for the YouTube and TikTok shorts. I tried doing this one by one, but realised quickly this isn't sustainable...

So...the easiest solution I could come up with was to just make it publicly available for everyone!  

Moving forward, I'll be storing the code snippets I use in my online content so you can replicate the examples in your own environments or use it as a learning resource in a way that makes sense for you!


## Who can use it? 🌍

Anyone can use the code for any purposes, and it's designed for beginners and advanced developers alike. 

I try to write the code in a way that's easy for myself to read and follow without compromising on best practices, and hopefully the same applies to you. 


## Can I copy and paste your code for my project...? 📋

Yeah of course! 

Feel free to use it as you need.


## How's the repo structured...? 📂

At the moment, the code examples are split into these directories:

- `/python` - for Python-related tutorials and examples.
- `/sql` - for SQL-related tutorials and examples.
